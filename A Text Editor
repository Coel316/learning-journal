What is a text Editor ?

A text editor is a softwre program, wether on your computer or online, that allows you to write and maintain code.
The text editor is an important tool that a programmer can use.

There are many text editors but you should look for features that fit your programming style.  

Some include:
1. Proper drop down option selections of the editor.
2. Syntax correction.
3. Color coding abilities.
4. Proper choice selection of extensions.
5. Auto completion / correction.
6. Support for the editor.

Always remember, in choosing a text editor, there's no wrong or right editor.  Choose the editor that fits your 
lifestyle.  For some people they prefer to use a Mac (which comes with various editors) and others choose PC, which 
also has a few editors.  Some are free and there are some that cost.  In the end, it's the outcome / output that 
is most important.  It's the end result that matters. A happy consumer.
