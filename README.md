**The growth mindset**

By: Coel

One can never stop learning.  We should never think that "we have arrived" when we learn.
From the womb, and before, learning starts and should always be continued.  There are some 
who say that if you stop learning, you start dying ???  Learning is like a muscle - exercise it
or loose some of it functions  :-)

Three ways to help me keep a "growth mindset" are:
- Never stop learning
- Never let anyone stop you from learning (even if you have a disability)
- Use your mental functions often - as you would exercise if you were a physical trainer.
