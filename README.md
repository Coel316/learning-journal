The growth mindset 

One can never stop learning.  We should never think that "we have arrived" when we learn.
From the womb, and before, learning starts and should always be continued.  There are some 
who say that if you stop learning, you start dying ???  Learning is like a muscle - exercise it
or loose some of it functions  :-)
