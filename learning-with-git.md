Git + Github

Some of the things I have learned today that is very important is the fact that
there is a BIG difference etween git and Github.

The main difference between the 2 is that git resides on your local computer
and Github resides in the cloud.

With that said git and Github needs to be working as one.

Today I learned:

- How to clone repositories and put them on my local computer
- Why use local computer to update Github - one of which is to locally fix typos 
    and errors
- Clean up entire site.
