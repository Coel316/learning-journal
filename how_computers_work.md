## Basic computer function:

Input
Process
Storage
Output

It looks like to me that all electronic 
equipment deals with these 4 functions.

- They all have 1's and 0's.

Everything from Radio, TV, sound, Internet (even wireless), Computers, Phones, etc all have a part to play in the  processing 0's and 1's.

Thse 0's and 1's can turn into words, pictures, etc.
They eventually turn into numbers.

Numbers can get BIG. Millions and Billions and more...
