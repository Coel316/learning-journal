### What is a script ?

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
- Think of scripts like a manual, recipe or a handbook.

To write a script
1. State / define your intentions. What do you want to achieve ?
2. Write down steps that you need to complete. If possible use a flowchart.
3. Make sure you code each step AND if possible comments using // or */
    *  Every step i a flow chart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand.
